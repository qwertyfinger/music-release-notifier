<h3>Technical side</h3>
Application codebase suffers from lack of a proper architecture and usage of not the most suitable supporting libraries. It's going to be completely rewritten in a more appropriate fashion, using MVP architecture and Reactive programming.

The necessary data is available thanks to <a href="http://www.last.fm">Last.fm</a>, <a href="http://www.setlist.fm">Deezer</a> and [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) via their APIs.
